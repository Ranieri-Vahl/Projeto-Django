# Recipes-Django

The recipe is a site where registered and logged in users can share recipes. These recipes, when sent, go through a validation by Admins, verifying if the recipe can be made public on the site or not, if approved, the recipe is posted. The user can also edit his recipe and look at his profile for those he has already posted.
Recipes can contain Category and Tags assigned by Admins so that the user can better filter their searches, in addition, the customer also has the option of searching for a recipe by title or description in the search bar.
The site was deployed on Google Cloud for free for another 2 months, I invite you to visit it at the link below:
